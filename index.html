      <h2> Biography </h2>
      <p> As one of the most popular DJs of the late-2000s EDM boom, Grammy-nominated Swedish producer Avicii went on to top the charts
      in multiple countries and tour the world with his uplifting house anthems. Born Tim Bergling in Stockholm in 1989, he began
      making music at the age of 18, writing and remixing tracks in his bedroom and uploading them onto the Internet. Influenced
      by Daft Punk and Steve Angello, his melodic house sound gained a huge following, which led to support from both Tiësto, who
      invited him to perform a weekly residency at Privilege in Ibiza, and Pete Tong, who released first single "Manman" through
      his Bedroom Bedlam label. </p>
      <p> In addition to remixing tracks for Little Boots, Robyn, and Dizzee Rascal, Bergling issued a handful of his own singles,
      like "Bromance" and "My Feelings for You" in 2010. "Seek Bromance" -- which added the vocals of Amanda Wilson atop his earlier
      track -- became a modest hit across Europe. However, it wasn't until his next single, 2011's "Levels," that his international
      popularity exploded. Featuring a sample of Etta James' "Something's Got a Hold on Me," the track topped dance charts across
      the globe and reached platinum status in at least ten countries, launching Avicii into the mainstream. </p>
      <p> Toward the end of 2012, Bergling issued "I Could Be the One," a collaborative single with Nicky Romero. The song became another
      hit for the producer and was featured heavily on reality TV shows and European radio. The following year, he released the
      single "Wake Me Up." Featuring the vocals of Aloe Blacc, the pastoral soul track peaked at the top of the charts in over
      20 countries, making it his biggest hit to date. That "folktronica" sound would feature heavily on his debut album, True,
      which arrived in late 2013. The multi-platinum LP featured guests like Adam Lambert, MØ, and Nile Rodgers, and produced four
      additional hit singles like "Hey Brother" and "Addicted to You." A version of the album featuring Bergling's own club remixes
      -- the aptly titled True: Avicii by Avicii -- arrived in 2014. That same year, Bergling scored another mainstream hit with
      "A Sky Full of Stars," a collaboration with Coldplay. </p>
      <p> In late 2015, his sophomore album, Stories, arrived. Continuing his cross-genre exploration of EDM and pop, Bergling recruited
      guests like Zac Brown, Wyclef Jean, Matisyahu, and Martin Garrix for the effort, which topped the Billboard dance chart upon
      release. While he continued to perform and release new music, Bergling announced in early 2016 that he would retire from
      the live scene due to persistent health concerns. That summer, he performed his final live set in Ibiza. </p>
      <p> New music in the form of the Avici (01) EP arrived in summer 2017 while Bergling continued to produce material for an expected
      second and third installment of the EP series. However, on April 20, 2018, he suddenly passed away in Muscat, Oman at the
      age of 28. </p>
